For this plugin to work, you first need to buy/download the latest version of Audio-Video Chat software from <a href=”http://avchat.net/buy-now” title=”Buy AVChat”>here</a>
After that, follow these steps:

1. Connect to your web site hosting account using FTP
2. Upload the avchat3 folder (from avchat-3.zip) to your ***/wp-content/plugins*** folder

4. Chmod the ***/wp-content/plugins/avchat3/uploadedFiles*** folder to 777 (otherwise the upload function might not work)
